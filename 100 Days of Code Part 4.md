### Friday, 17 November, 2023

Today, I delved deep into learning ArcGIS and found a wonderful set of resources through the official documentation. 

# Day 401
### Saturday, 18 November, 2023

Today, after a decent amount of study into ArcGIS, I decided upon the ES module for JavaScript for the method I would use to build my project. There is a lot to ArcGIS. 

### Sunday, 19 November, 2023

Scheduled day off from coding. 

# Day 402
### Monday, 20 November, 2023

Today, I started off by looking back at my prior journal entries and discovered that I had miscounted and was actually on day 402. I also decided to switch to markdown instead of HTML as I think markdown will be easier to use. After that, I continued my study of ArcGIS. I will spend more time studying tomorrow and Wednesday, and then will formally start coding on Thursday.

# Day 403
### Tuesday, 21 November, 2023

Started reading Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps by Rene Rubalcava. Tomorrow, I should be able to finish it, and then Thursday, I get to start programming. 

# Day 404
### Wednesday, 22 November, 2023

Today, I read the book Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps and found a wonderful github repository showing a complete project that I can use to figure out everything I need to build my own project. Tomorrow, I get to start actually coding!

# Day 405
### Thursday, 23 November, 2023

Today, I found a few wonderful resources that got me a solid start on my code. Not much is in the repository right now, but that will change tomorrow. 

# Day 406
### Friday, 24 November, 2023

Yay! I got the base map running for my app. Right now, it is centered over the area I want it to show and that is about it, but that is a huge step from where I was at. Tomorrow, I get to build in points of interest and then build in the weather portion and I should be good. 

# Day 407
### Saturday, 25 November, 2023

Today, I finished my weather map project using ArcGIS, JavaScript, and HTML. This project provides the foundation for a weather and travel map that will help you plan for longer trips. In this case it pulls from major landmarks along the path and then gets the current weather from the National Weather Service for each selected landmark along the path, and displays the 7-day forecast and any weather alerts for the area around the landmark.

Scheduled day off from Coding

# Day 408
### Monday, 27 November, 2023

Today, I started learning SQL in preparation for my SQL database project. As I started learning, my initial impression was that SQL was basically a spreadsheet on steroids through powerful automation systems, and while I realize now that likely does not do it justice, I still see the connection. 

# Day 409
### Tuesday, 28 November, 2023

Today, I started going through the Introduction to SQLite Databases for Python Programming course. It is a wonderful introduction on SQLite. Per my plan, I have been following along recreating what I am learning about, and playing with it to experiment a bit on my own as I learn. I do think I am picking things up a lot faster by doing more rather than just reading/watching/listening to something, which is kind of expected considering how much more I learn through completing projects. I highly recommend to those trying to learn programming that they start doing projects. You learn a whole lot through the process. 

# Day 410
### Wednesday, 29 November, 2023

Today, I continued going through the Introduction to SQLite Databases for Python Programming course. Tomorrow, I will be starting the final chapter of the tutorial and I will get to build a basic SQL app. I am very much looking forward to that. 

# Day 411
### Thursday, 30 November, 2023

While following the SQL course today, they talked about how in each function, we need to create a cursor and connect to the database to start, and then commit any changes and finally close the connection to the database and that we would need to copy and past it into each function. As they talked about it, my first thought was to wonder if there was a way to put those copy pasted sections of code into a function, and sure enough, with a bit of work, I was able to figure it out. From there, as we went into the next function, I happily used my two functions instead of copying instead pasting the code. But then, when I created the next function, I found myself copying and pasting the function calls because I realized they would be the same in both functions. Then when I went onto the third, I remembered about inheritance and with a bit of research, figured out how to make a wrapper function in python to not have to copy and paste my function calls every time I went to make a new function. I just needed to tell the program I am using my decorator function. And as I looked back at my refactored code, I gained a new appreciation for the dry principle and for inheritance. I did not finish the tutorial, but I learned a wonderful lesson because I did not simply copy what the person on the video was doing and took time to think and reason out what I was seeing and trying to do. I honestly think that if I were not trying to build a project, I would not likely have been thinking about what I was doing as much as I was, and thus would not have learned nearly as much. 

# Day 412
### Friday, 1 December, 2023

Today, I finished the course/tutorial I started a few days ago. I very much went beyond the scope the tutorial went through. For example, in the tutorial they just copied and pasted the connection to the database, and the creation of a cursor along with the committing of any changes and the closing of the connection into each function where I chose to figure out how to make a wrapper function to put those parts into. From there, when they introduced the idea of searching for an individual piece of data they did so via creating a dedicated function and in the process copied code from their function designed to print the data stored in the database out, where I chose to refactor my print statement to allow an optional argument that would let me just use my existing function called within my search function. From there, I also chose to modify the search function to let me use the same function to search for any type of data I want in the database. I started this tutorial (they call it a course) not simply with the intention of getting introduced to SQL, but with the intention of helping me complete a project that I have until 9 December 2023 to complete. I chose to go above and beyond what the tutorial suggested because I want to build the best project I can within the time I have given myself and that required actively thinking about the concepts I was introduced to, and pushing beyond what was introduced. The tutorial I went through was just a basic introduction. I scheduled a bit more time for learning and practicing; additionally, thanks to this tutorial ... and the extra work I put into learning from it, I have a wealth of resources that can help me with my project, so I think I am going to next find a more advanced course to follow and then see what I can learn from it before I formally start building my project next Thursday. 

# Day 413
### 2 December 2023

Today, was kind of an easy day. I went through the SQL tutorial on W3 schools. I know it was not much, but that was the most I had to give today. 

### 3 December 2023

Scheduled day off from Coding

# Day 414
### 4 December 2023

Today, I formally started on my project. I modified the functions I previously built in the tutorial to be able to use them for my project. Now, I need to build a menu to use the program with, and from there, expand on the project a bit, and then I should be done. 

# Day 415
### 5 December 2023

Today, I finished the menu for my program. Right now, it is a basic console interface, and I built the ability to look up a record by the rowid, and generated a list of random names and emails and added them to a csv file for testing purposes. I also added the ability to read a list of names from a CSV file. 

### 6 December 2023

Today, I took an unscheduled day off to try to get better. 

### 7 December 2023

Took one more day off to get feeling better. I think I should be able to get back to programming tomorrow. 

### 8 December 2023

Took final day off to recover

# Day 416
### 9 December 2023

Today I finished my first project using SQL. This basic program manages a student database using SQLite. It provides CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), custom search, data sorting, and calculates remaining days until graduation. Users interact with the program through a menu-driven interface simplifying student data management. 

# Day 417 
### 26 December 2023

I am back at it. I took a break to avoid getting sick before I graduated. Today was spent getting my projects added to my resume and various online sites. 

# Day 418
### 1 January 2024

Today, I started learning Lua in preparation for my next project. I see a lot of similarity to Python, at least in the first hour of my study. I will see what tomorrow will bring for my next project. I also decided I would restart a book I started reading a few months ago and then had to stop due to schedule conflicts. While I remember many of the concepts the earlier chapters talk about there are a few I want a deeper dive into, so I thought it worth the time to restart. For my project for this month, while the exact nature of the add-on is subject to change after I finish going through what is and is not allow, my project for this month is to build an add-on for Elder Scrolls Online. 

# Day 419
### 2 January 2024

Today, I continued learning Lua. I could go through the content quicker than I am, but I am enjoying taking my time. It was a rather light day of programming, but I also had to deal with overtime at work, so I am fine with that. 

# Day 420
### 3 January 2024

Today, was a day mostly spent studying. The following are my notes. 

I once heard that the first Nintendo Gameboy has more computer technology in it than they used to send a man to the moon. While I never actually verified that claim I can believe it is true, but even if it were not true of that now ancient piece of technology, I can certainly believe it to be true of the marvel of technology that is our modern smartphone. From the first time I heard that claim, I was left to ponder on how much we must be under utilizing the technology we have at our fingertips. If a group of people could use less technology than what we carry in our pockets to send a man to the moon, why can't we use that same marvel of a device to propel our futures to be filled with a grander set of tomorrows?

In the book, Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python, Bradley N. Miller and David L. Ranum (Problem Solving) state that "The science of computing is concerned with using computers to solve problems." While I liked that line the first time I read it, I didn't fully appreciate it until I read it again and stopped to ponder on it, and as I pondered on the implications of that line I realized that in too many cases, I am not using my phone or computer to solve problems.
But how to use that insight to help me become a better programmer? 
Problem Solving, like any other skill needs to be learned and practiced. So, as I spend more time practicing the skill of problem solving, I will get better at it and then will be able to apply those skills in more areas, like my programming efforts.

On page 2 of Problem Solving, we read "Given a problem a computer scientist's goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise."

So, if the algorithm is a step by step solution to a problem, and the program is written to solve a problem, then the whole program is the algorithm. A sufficiently complex problem might be broken down into smaller sub problems, which might have its own set of steps to solve, but that is still part of the larger algorithm. This means that, on at least a macro level, there is no difference between the algorithm and the program. Thus, learning to master algorithms better is also the process of learning to write programs better. More specifically, learning to think and program in algorithms, will help take programming to more of a predictable science that is easier to plan out.
