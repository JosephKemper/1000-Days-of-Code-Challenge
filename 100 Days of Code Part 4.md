### Friday, 17 November 2023

Today, I delved deep into learning ArcGIS and found a wonderful set of resources through the official documentation. 

# Day 401
### Saturday, 18 November 2023

Today, after a decent amount of study into ArcGIS, I decided upon the ES module for JavaScript for the method I would use to build my project. There is a lot to ArcGIS. 

### Sunday, 19 November 2023

Scheduled day off from coding. 

# Day 402
### Monday, 20 November 2023

Today, I started off by looking back at my prior journal entries and discovered that I had miscounted and was actually on day 402. I also decided to switch to markdown instead of HTML as I think markdown will be easier to use. After that, I continued my study of ArcGIS. I will spend more time studying tomorrow and Wednesday, and then will formally start coding on Thursday.

# Day 403
### Tuesday, 21 November 2023

Started reading Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps by Rene Rubalcava. Tomorrow, I should be able to finish it, and then Thursday, I get to start programming.
