# Day 400
### Friday, 17 November, 2023

Today, I delved deep into learning ArcGIS and found a wonderful set of resources through the official documentation. 

# Day 401
### Saturday, 18 November, 2023

Today, after a decent amount of study into ArcGIS, I decided upon the ES module for JavaScript for the method I would use to build my project. There is a lot to ArcGIS. 

### Sunday, 19 November, 2023

Scheduled day off from coding. 

# Day 402
### Monday, 20 November, 2023

Today, I started off by looking back at my prior journal entries and discovered that I had miscounted and was actually on day 402. I also decided to switch to markdown instead of HTML as I think markdown will be easier to use. After that, I continued my study of ArcGIS. I will spend more time studying tomorrow and Wednesday, and then will formally start coding on Thursday.

# Day 403
### Tuesday, 21 November, 2023

Started reading Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps by Rene Rubalcava. Tomorrow, I should be able to finish it, and then Thursday, I get to start programming. 

# Day 404
### Wednesday, 22 November, 2023

Today, I read the book Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps and found a wonderful github repository showing a complete project that I can use to figure out everything I need to build my own project. Tomorrow, I get to start actually coding!

# Day 405
### Thursday, 23 November, 2023

Today, I found a few wonderful resources that got me a solid start on my code. Not much is in the repository right now, but that will change tomorrow. 

# Day 406
### Friday, 24 November, 2023

Yay! I got the base map running for my app. Right now, it is centered over the area I want it to show and that is about it, but that is a huge step from where I was at. Tomorrow, I get to build in points of interest and then build in the weather portion and I should be good. 

# Day 407
### Saturday, 25 November, 2023

Today, I finished my weather map project using ArcGIS, JavaScript, and HTML. This project provides the foundation for a weather and travel map that will help you plan for longer trips. In this case it pulls from major landmarks along the path and then gets the current weather from the National Weather Service for each selected landmark along the path, and displays the 7-day forecast and any weather alerts for the area around the landmark.

### Sunday, 26 November, 2023

Scheduled day off from Coding

# Day 408
### Monday, 27 November, 2023

Today, I started learning SQL in preparation for my SQL database project. As I started learning, my initial impression was that SQL was basically a spreadsheet on steroids through powerful automation systems, and while I realize now that likely does not do it justice, I still see the connection. 

# Day 409
### Tuesday, 28 November, 2023

Today, I started going through the Introduction to SQLite Databases for Python Programming course. It is a wonderful introduction on SQLite. Per my plan, I have been following along recreating what I am learning about, and playing with it to experiment a bit on my own as I learn. I do think I am picking things up a lot faster by doing more rather than just reading/watching/listening to something, which is kind of expected considering how much more I learn through completing projects. I highly recommend to those trying to learn programming that they start doing projects. You learn a whole lot through the process. 

# Day 410
### Wednesday, 29 November, 2023

Today, I continued going through the Introduction to SQLite Databases for Python Programming course. Tomorrow, I will be starting the final chapter of the tutorial and I will get to build a basic SQL app. I am very much looking forward to that. 

# Day 411
### Thursday, 30 November, 2023

While following the SQL course today, they talked about how in each function, we need to create a cursor and connect to the database to start, and then commit any changes and finally close the connection to the database and that we would need to copy and past it into each function. As they talked about it, my first thought was to wonder if there was a way to put those copy pasted sections of code into a function, and sure enough, with a bit of work, I was able to figure it out. From there, as we went into the next function, I happily used my two functions instead of copying instead pasting the code. But then, when I created the next function, I found myself copying and pasting the function calls because I realized they would be the same in both functions. Then when I went onto the third, I remembered about inheritance and with a bit of research, figured out how to make a wrapper function in python to not have to copy and paste my function calls every time I went to make a new function. I just needed to tell the program I am using my decorator function. And as I looked back at my refactored code, I gained a new appreciation for the dry principle and for inheritance. I did not finish the tutorial, but I learned a wonderful lesson because I did not simply copy what the person on the video was doing and took time to think and reason out what I was seeing and trying to do. I honestly think that if I were not trying to build a project, I would not likely have been thinking about what I was doing as much as I was, and thus would not have learned nearly as much. 

# Day 412
### Friday, 1 December, 2023

Today, I finished the course/tutorial I started a few days ago. I very much went beyond the scope the tutorial went through. For example, in the tutorial they just copied and pasted the connection to the database, and the creation of a cursor along with the committing of any changes and the closing of the connection into each function where I chose to figure out how to make a wrapper function to put those parts into. From there, when they introduced the idea of searching for an individual piece of data they did so via creating a dedicated function and in the process copied code from their function designed to print the data stored in the database out, where I chose to refactor my print statement to allow an optional argument that would let me just use my existing function called within my search function. From there, I also chose to modify the search function to let me use the same function to search for any type of data I want in the database. I started this tutorial (they call it a course) not simply with the intention of getting introduced to SQL, but with the intention of helping me complete a project that I have until 9 December 2023 to complete. I chose to go above and beyond what the tutorial suggested because I want to build the best project I can within the time I have given myself and that required actively thinking about the concepts I was introduced to, and pushing beyond what was introduced. The tutorial I went through was just a basic introduction. I scheduled a bit more time for learning and practicing; additionally, thanks to this tutorial ... and the extra work I put into learning from it, I have a wealth of resources that can help me with my project, so I think I am going to next find a more advanced course to follow and then see what I can learn from it before I formally start building my project next Thursday. 

# Day 413
### 2 December 2023

Today, was kind of an easy day. I went through the SQL tutorial on W3 schools. I know it was not much, but that was the most I had to give today. 

### 3 December 2023

Scheduled day off from Coding

# Day 414
### 4 December 2023

Today, I formally started on my project. I modified the functions I previously built in the tutorial to be able to use them for my project. Now, I need to build a menu to use the program with, and from there, expand on the project a bit, and then I should be done. 

# Day 415
### 5 December 2023

Today, I finished the menu for my program. Right now, it is a basic console interface, and I built the ability to look up a record by the rowid, and generated a list of random names and emails and added them to a csv file for testing purposes. I also added the ability to read a list of names from a CSV file. 

### 6 December 2023

Today, I took an unscheduled day off to try to get better. 

### 7 December 2023

Took one more day off to get feeling better. I think I should be able to get back to programming tomorrow. 

### 8 December 2023

Took final day off to recover

# Day 416
### 9 December 2023

Today I finished my first project using SQL. This basic program manages a student database using SQLite. It provides CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), custom search, data sorting, and calculates remaining days until graduation. Users interact with the program through a menu-driven interface simplifying student data management. 

# Day 417 
### 26 December 2023

I am back at it. I took a break to avoid getting sick before I graduated. Today was spent getting my projects added to my resume and various online sites. 

# Day 418
### 1 January 2024

Today, I started learning Lua in preparation for my next project. I see a lot of similarity to Python, at least in the first hour of my study. I will see what tomorrow will bring for my next project. I also decided I would restart a book I started reading a few months ago and then had to stop due to schedule conflicts. While I remember many of the concepts the earlier chapters talk about there are a few I want a deeper dive into, so I thought it worth the time to restart. For my project for this month, while the exact nature of the add-on is subject to change after I finish going through what is and is not allow, my project for this month is to build an add-on for Elder Scrolls Online. 

# Day 419
### 2 January 2024

Today, I continued learning Lua. I could go through the content quicker than I am, but I am enjoying taking my time. It was a rather light day of programming, but I also had to deal with overtime at work, so I am fine with that. 

# Day 420
### 3 January 2024

Today, was a day mostly spent studying. The following are my notes. 

I once heard that the first Nintendo Gameboy has more computer technology in it than they used to send a man to the moon. While I never actually verified that claim I can believe it is true, but even if it were not true of that now ancient piece of technology, I can certainly believe it to be true of the marvel of technology that is our modern smartphone. From the first time I heard that claim, I was left to ponder on how much we must be under utilizing the technology we have at our fingertips. If a group of people could use less technology than what we carry in our pockets to send a man to the moon, why can't we use that same marvel of a device to propel our futures to be filled with a grander set of tomorrows?

In the book, Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python, Bradley N. Miller and David L. Ranum (Problem Solving) state that "The science of computing is concerned with using computers to solve problems." While I liked that line the first time I read it, I didn't fully appreciate it until I read it again and stopped to ponder on it, and as I pondered on the implications of that line I realized that in too many cases, I am not using my phone or computer to solve problems.
But how to use that insight to help me become a better programmer? 
Problem Solving, like any other skill needs to be learned and practiced. So, as I spend more time practicing the skill of problem solving, I will get better at it and then will be able to apply those skills in more areas, like my programming efforts.

On page 2 of Problem Solving, we read "Given a problem a computer scientist's goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise."

So, if the algorithm is a step by step solution to a problem, and the program is written to solve a problem, then the whole program is the algorithm. A sufficiently complex problem might be broken down into smaller sub problems, which might have its own set of steps to solve, but that is still part of the larger algorithm. This means that, on at least a macro level, there is no difference between the algorithm and the program. Thus, learning to master algorithms better is also the process of learning to write programs better. More specifically, learning to think and program in algorithms, will help take programming to more of a predictable science that is easier to plan out. 

# Day 421
### Thursday, 4 January, 2024

I got lost in my book today, and learned a whole lot. I also decided to modify my digging deeper blog to be a sort of programming blog. I like the direction it feels like it will be going. 

# Day 422
### Friday, 5 January, 2024

I am really enjoying my new study trick for my book. I love not just reading but stopping to ponder about the applications of what I am reading. It really helps me get a lot more out of it. I am also back on my game for feeling motivated and put another hour into the Code Academy Lua Course. I could go through it faster than I am, but I am taking my time with it and making sure to take it fully in. 

# Day 423
### Saturday, 6 January, 2024

I am about half done with the Code Academy Lua lesson and found a few wonderful insights from my algorithms book. The big take away I have so far is that the program should be written from the algorithm, which was a wonderful insight to gain. Which means that I am getting a lot of content for my next blog post and am building a solid foundation for my first Elder Scrolls Online Add-on. 

### Sunday, 7 January, 2024
Scheduled day off from Coding

# Day 424
### Monday, 8 January, 2024

Today, I redid my plan for the year, and formally started my first Software company. I have a very basic website that I created, and that will be live within 2 days and got the repository created for my first project, a project planner, that I will use to plan out my future projects. My second project is going to be a bug tracker. Tomorrow, I will formally start planning everything I will be putting into this project. 

# Day 425
### Tuesday, 9 January, 2024

Today, I started planning the features I want to have in my project planner tool that I will be building. I am not done yet, but I have a good start. I know I want the tool to be useable from the initial conception of the idea to the projects completion. I also know that I want to use it to collect ideas for potential projects from anyone, even those not in the company, while still maintaining privacy of those ideas we want to keep behind closed doors. 

# Day 426
### Wednesday, 10 January, 2024

Not much to report programming wise today, I had an hour of overtime and a Toastmasters meeting that ran long. I did work more on the plan for my project management app, just not as much as I would have wanted. 

# Day 427
### Thursday, 11 January, 2024

I think I am almost done brainstorming all the features I want in my project management app. I will probably spend a few more days trying to think about features, I want to go big with this project. 

# Day 428
### Friday, 12 January, 2024

I got a little farther on brainstorming the features I want in my project management app. I am probably going too big, but I really don't care, I want this to be the biggest most challenging thing I have ever done, and am expecting to spend at least 3 to 4 months completing it, so I am fine going big. 

# Day 429
### Saturday, 13 January, 2024

I finished brainstorming all the ideas I want to build into my project management app. I now need to build mockups of the software and then from there, I can start the algorithm design phase of my project. 

### Sunday, 14 January, 2024

Scheduled day off from coding.

# Day 430
### Monday, 15 January, 2024

Today, I was going to work on either a mockup of the UI or the algorithm for the app, then I realized that I needed a better idea of what I want it to do and how I want it to work. So, today, was spent looking at different existing project management apps to see how they work. I have a bit more work to do on that front, but I have a much better understanding now.

# Day 431
### Tuesday, 16 January, 2024

Today, I spent gathering info on what I want my app to look like and having an in depth look at the possible features I might add to it. It is a lot more work than I expected it to be. 

# Day 432
### Wednesday, 17 January, 2024

Today, I started working on the algorithm for the app. I did not get very far, but I am happy with the progress I am making. Right now, I am figuring out what custom data structures I will need for my program to run. 

# Day 433
### Thursday, 18 January, 2024

I got two more data structures planned out. I had to deal with more overtime again and that limited what I could do. Hopefully next week will be the last week for mandatory overtime. 

# Day 434
### Friday, 19 January, 2024

I think I finally figured out the roadblock I have been battling through. This will be by far, the biggest project I will have ever completed, and trying to go from where I am currently at, to where I want to go, is too big of a leap. So, instead of trying to plan the whole thing, I am going to plan and build it in stages. First, I will plan and build the minimum viable product, and then will expand on it from there. 

# Day 435
### Saturday, 20 January, 2024

Today, I got the goals for the minimum viable project (MVP) version of my project management app written up and broken down into a list of features. I realized that part of what was going on is that I was just having a hard time trying to make the leap from concept in my mind, to a fleshed out app with a proper graphical user interface (GUI). As I looked at the list of features I wanted in the list of features I planned for my MVP version, I could easily conceptualize how the GUI side of things might look and or work. But even with that in mind, I still plan on going through with the console version first, then modifying it to be a graphical version. Yes, I realize that it will be a lot of work, but that will best help me navigate the course from concept to working program. 

### Sunday, 21 January, 2024

Scheduled day off from coding. 

# Day 436
### Monday, 22 January, 2024

A friend responded to my request for ideas for new features for my project management app with a suggestion and that gave me ideas for 8 new features I want to program in. I also realized that I was  not planning a minimum anything for this project. As I look at my goals, it feels like I am trying to build an enterprize grade piece of software that would be used in large companies. So, that is what I am going to shoot for. I want to build this to a scale that a large company might be able to use it if they wanted to. I did not get very far on the process of detailing out the first feature, but, that will take time. I am kind of still in the idea generation phase. So, if I were to describe this project, in a summary form, then how would I describe it?

This currently unnamed project management software, will include a full suite of every tool needed to manage a project, whether as a single person, or as a large corporation. The goal is to include everything you could possibly need to manage a project. From estimating the completion date, to estimating the hours actually spent on the project, and from tracking what resources you might need to figuring out which project or task needs to be completed in which order and it will notify you of when you are risking falling behind. 

# Day 437
### Tuesday, 23 January, 2024

I ran into a brief roadblock for designing my project management app, specifically the details of what differentiates a project from a task. It is interesting how two things that seem so obviously different at first can have the lines between them so blurred when trying to decide what data should be managed by a class representing each of them. However, today, I was able to plan out what will go into an idea, goal, project, and task. I also decided to add a person class to manage all data connected with a person in the project, but have not planned that as of yet. 

# Day 438
### Wednesday, 24 January, 2024

Today, I planned out what I want to have my person data class track within my person data class. 

# Day 439
### Thursday, 25 January, 2024

As result of talking with a friend, I added another feature I want to include in my project, specifically analytics technology that will let the program better forecast how long it will take to complete a task using data collected from past jobs completed by an individual. I also want to make versions of this data available to everyone, with the specific goal of encouraging growth opportunities. I realize this is already a huge project, but I really don't care, I am having fun with it, and I know I will learn a lot when I move from the planning to the programming stages. 

# Day 440
### Friday, 26 January, 2024

I am about half done with fleshing out the details for the features I plan to include in my project management app. From there, I will start planning out the classes and from there, will start to actually build the program. 

# Day 441
### Saturday, 27 January, 2024

I got the details for a few more features planned out. I am hoping to be done fleshing out the details for the features by next Saturday, then I get to start planning out what classes, functions, and variables I will need, and start building the UML diagrams for everything. 

### Sunday, 28 January, 2024

Scheduled day off from coding. 

# Day 442
### Monday, 29 January, 2024

Today, I got a the details for a few more features planned out, and started thinking on how I will build a rather difficult challenge, specifically, how I will teach the computer to give a recommendation on how to plan out the project. That will take a bit, but I have done similar things in the past in my business class, I just need to figure out a way to automate it. 

# Day 445
### Tuesday, 30 January, 2024

Today, I got a plan for how I will build a suggested completion timeline for a list of projects and/or tasks that are being added to my app. I even thought of a few ways for how I will actually write the code. The big things I learned in the process is that when planning out a project, I do not need to worry about how I will write the code, I just need to worry about breaking everything down into workable and logical steps. 

# Day 446
### Wednesday, 31 January, 2024

Yay! I finished fleshing out the details to the different features I want to include in my project management app, and I am glad I took the time to do that, because there were a few things I wanted to include that I was not sure if I could actually do, but then by taking the time to think about them in more detail I have a much better idea (and in some cases an actual plan) of how I could do them. So that means starting tomorrow, I can start working on the UML (not ugly monkey legs) diagrams for the classes and planning the details to how I will build everything when I start programming.  

# Day 447
### Thursday, 1 February, 2024

Today, I made the first UML diagram for my project. I ended up using Draw.io to make the diagram and then just saved it to a png file. And now, that I have everything created, tomorrow I should be able to get more than one done. 

# Day 448
### Friday, 2 February, 2024

I decided to switch the tool I was using to create UML diagrams. I realized that as useful as draw.io is, it was not ideal for my needs. After a bit of research, I found that UMLet was a lot better for what I am trying to do, and still lets me get good screen shots. So, after I quickly redid the UML for the Idea class, I also did the UML for the Goal and Project classes. 

# Day 449
### Saturday, 3 February, 2024

I did not get as much done as I was hoping for today, but I still made progress so I am happy. I got the person and task UML diagrams completed and polished up the features of the task to avoid repetition between parent and child classes. 

### Sunday, 4 February, 2024

Scheduled day off from Coding

# Day 450
### Monday, 5 February, 2024

Today, was a bit of an off day, but I still put in some time working on the plan for my app. In this case, I planned some of the rest of the structure of my app. 

# Day 451
### Tuesday, 6 February, 2024

Today I started building the UML diagram for the unique identifier for each idea, goal, project, and task that will be created within an account. I settled on the idea of using the first letter of the item type being created, the date in YYYYMMDD format, and then the number of the particular item that was created that day, so for example if I were creating the 4th project for that day and the date were 6 February, 2024, then the unique project id would be P202402064. I am rather enjoying building out the UML diagrams, for everything after my initial planning as it is forcing me to think at a whole different level on everything. 

# Day 452
### Wednesday, 7 February, 2024

Today, I finished the UML diagrams for all of the unique identifier classes. 

### Thursday, 8 February, 2024
