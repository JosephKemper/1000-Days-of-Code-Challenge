Today, I delved deep into learning ArcGIS and found a wonderful set of resources through the official documentation. 

# Day 401
### Saturday, 18 November, 2023

Today, after a decent amount of study into ArcGIS, I decided upon the ES module for JavaScript for the method I would use to build my project. There is a lot to ArcGIS. 

### Sunday, 19 November, 2023

Scheduled day off from coding. 

# Day 402
### Monday, 20 November, 2023

Today, I started off by looking back at my prior journal entries and discovered that I had miscounted and was actually on day 402. I also decided to switch to markdown instead of HTML as I think markdown will be easier to use. After that, I continued my study of ArcGIS. I will spend more time studying tomorrow and Wednesday, and then will formally start coding on Thursday.

# Day 403
### Tuesday, 21 November, 2023

Started reading Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps by Rene Rubalcava. Tomorrow, I should be able to finish it, and then Thursday, I get to start programming. 

# Day 404
### Wednesday, 22 November, 2023

Today, I read the book Introducing ArcGIS API 4 for JavaScript: Turn Awesome Maps into Awesome Apps and found a wonderful github repository showing a complete project that I can use to figure out everything I need to build my own project. Tomorrow, I get to start actually coding!

# Day 405
### Thursday, 23 November, 2023

Today, I found a few wonderful resources that got me a solid start on my code. Not much is in the repository right now, but that will change tomorrow. 

# Day 406
### Friday, 24 November, 2023

Yay! I got the base map running for my app. Right now, it is centered over the area I want it to show and that is about it, but that is a huge step from where I was at. Tomorrow, I get to build in points of interest and then build in the weather portion and I should be good. 

# Day 407
### Saturday, 25 November, 2023

Today, I finished my weather map project using ArcGIS, JavaScript, and HTML. This project provides the foundation for a weather and travel map that will help you plan for longer trips. In this case it pulls from major landmarks along the path and then gets the current weather from the National Weather Service for each selected landmark along the path, and displays the 7-day forecast and any weather alerts for the area around the landmark.
