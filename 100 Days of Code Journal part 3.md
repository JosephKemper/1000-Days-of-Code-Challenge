    After a few days of studying and pondering, I think I have finally figured out how I am going to format my blog post on string methods.

    Today, I started working on my next blog post, and got my last three actually published. They are deep dives into three data structures, specifically on stacks, sets, and binary search trees. You can see them here. https://josephkemper.github.io/DiggingDeeper/DataStructuresTutoiral/

    Between my studies yesterday and today, I realized that doing a deep dive into the remaining data structures from my data structures class will be more beneficial than doing a deep dive into the basics of Python. I will likely go back and finish the deep dive I started, but I am going to finish gaining a deep understanding of the data structures first, and will then dive more into algorithms. After that, I will consider diving back into the basics.

    Yay! I got my first three blog posts published on my new blog. They are deep dive tutorials on Sets, Stacks, and Binary Search Trees in Python. My next project is to write deep dive tutorials on Queues and Linked Lists in Python. You can view all my published tutorials on python data structures here. https://www.diggingdeeper.dev/python-data-structures-tutorial

    I was hoping to finish my blog post on queues, expanding it as I have, has taken a lot more than I was expecting. I'm about to go on a date with my wife, so, I don't know what will happen with the rest of the day. Either way, I am happy with my progress.
