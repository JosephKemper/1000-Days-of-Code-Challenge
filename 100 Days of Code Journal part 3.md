    Today, I started working on my next blog post, and got my last three actually published. They are deep dives into three data structures, specifically on stacks, sets, and binary search trees. You can see them here. https://josephkemper.github.io/DiggingDeeper/DataStructuresTutoiral/

    Between my studies yesterday and today, I realized that doing a deep dive into the remaining data structures from my data structures class will be more beneficial than doing a deep dive into the basics of Python. I will likely go back and finish the deep dive I started, but I am going to finish gaining a deep understanding of the data structures first, and will then dive more into algorithms. After that, I will consider diving back into the basics.

    Yay! I got my first three blog posts published on my new blog. They are deep dive tutorials on Sets, Stacks, and Binary Search Trees in Python. My next project is to write deep dive tutorials on Queues and Linked Lists in Python.

    I was hoping to finish my blog post on queues, expanding it as I have, has taken a lot more than I was expecting. I'm about to go on a date with my wife, so, I don't know what will happen with the rest of the day. Either way, I am happy with my progress.

<p>
    Today, I wrote the section of my blog that gives a challenge involving using the Breadth-First Search algorithm. This was my first time using that algorithm so I learned a lot. I also started studying for the last part of my blog post, a tutorial of how to complete sliding window maximum problem. I still have a bit more study to do to get ready to write that section, and fully expect to have a lot of fun figuring that out well enough to teach someone else how to complete it.

    Today, I started writing the last section of my blog post on queues. I studied about the Sliding Window Maximum algorithm for most of my time today. Tomorrow, I will finish my blog post and publish it. Then I will start preparing the last blog post I currently have planned on data structures and will then move directly to a series on algorithms.

    Today I finished my queues blog post. In the process of writing it, I learned about and wrote basic implementations of the Sliding Window Maximum, Breadth-First Search, and Kruskalâ€™s algorithm. Next, I will be publishing a lesson on Linked Lists. From there, I will start a series doing deep dives into algorithms.

    After finishing my last post, I ended up wondering if I could dig a little deeper in my posts and perhaps put a better example of each data structure in the blog post. As I already stated my next project was going to involve writing a lesson on Linked Lists, I decided to see what I could do to dig deeper into linked lists. After a bit of study and pondering, what I came to was the idea of Both demonstrating the built in data structure (assuming one exists) and building my own in the process of my lesson. And I think I like that idea. So, my goal for linked lists is to take and both dive into the deque and build a doubly linked list.
