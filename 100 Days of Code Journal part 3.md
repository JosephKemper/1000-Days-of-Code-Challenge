<p>
    Between my studies yesterday and today, I realized that doing a deep dive into the remaining data structures from my data structures class will be more beneficial than doing a deep dive into the basics of Python. I will likely go back and finish the deep dive I started, but I am going to finish gaining a deep understanding of the data structures first, and will then dive more into algorithms. After that, I will consider diving back into the basics.

    Monday, 21 August, 2023

<p>
    After finishing my last post, I ended up wondering if I could dig a little deeper in my posts and perhaps put a better example of each data structure in the blog post. As I already stated my next project was going to involve writing a lesson on Linked Lists, I decided to see what I could do to dig deeper into linked lists. After a bit of study and pondering, what I came to was the idea of Both demonstrating the built in data structure (assuming one exists) and building my own in the process of my lesson. And I think I like that idea. So, my goal for linked lists is to take and both dive into the deque and build a doubly linked list.

    Today, I chose the six projects I will complete for my software development portfolio. They are a Task Manager (console based), a Health and Fitness App, a Personal Finance Manager, a Stock Market Analysis, a Weather Radar Map, a Student Records SQL database app. My goal is to create a minimum viable product for each project. If I have time, I will flesh each project out a bit more, but to start off, I will just build a minimum viable project and flesh it out afterwards. I am giving myself 14 weeks to complete the minimum viable product version of each of these projects. I still plan on keeping up my digging deeper blog, but right now, I want to get my software portfolio built.

    Today, I got the basic program for my consol based task manager written. In the process, I learned how to create and call functions in Kotlin, create variables and define them right away and wait to define them later, write if/else if/ else statements, use the when function, learned how to add and remove items from a list, learned how to call variables in a string, and check for multiple conditions in a user input to make sure it was within an acceptable range. In the process, I wrote 5 functions and used recursion to let the user select multiple options within the program.

I know I should have done those first along with my planning of the code, but right now this works better for me. I am still getting better at the planning side. The projects I am working on will help me with that. Along with completing the save and load functions, I also learned how to implement error handling in Kotlin, how to clear the contents of a list, how to import Java libraries into Kotlin, and how to both save data from a list to a file and how to load data from a file back into that same list.

I also figured out how to pull the current date from the computer, and how to calculate the time between two dates. I Have just over 30 minutes of time I need to put into my project to meet my goal (24 hours minimum) which at this point, will be spent making sure everything is working right. Then, if it is, I will record a demo of my project and upload it and move to the next project.

    Today, I tested my code, and found to my pleasant surprise that everything ran properly. I was not happy with how the dates were formatted, and tried to change those, but found that as I tried I kept creating more and more bugs, so I just stopped, returned it back to where I started (thank you version control) and have created an issue to remind myself of what I still need to do. However, for that one, I will figure it out the next time I open the program. So, after confirming my task manager was to a workable state, and had met or exceeded all of my goals for the program, I recorded a video demo of the program.

I also planned out my time for both learning the new technologies I will be using for this, actually writing the program, and (hopefully) publishing it to the Google Play Store. As currently planned, I will create a basic health and fitness app that lets users create and use custom workout routines, track their diet and weight.

<h3>
    Thursday, 5 October, 2023

<p>
    Today, I gained an appreciation for the power of working on projects instead of just studying. I have spent the last few days studying Jetpack, thinking that because of how new this idea is (specifically trying to write code to run in something other than the console) and now that I look back, I think I would have learned more had I just started coding and learned as I went. It's an interesting and counter intuitive idea. I like it.

<p>
    Okay, I am officially a fan of working in projects and specifically working under deadlines. The past few days, I studied a lot but gained very little. Today, I struggled to figure out a form to my program, what I want it to look like, how I want it to act, and what features I want it to have, and in the process, learned about composable functions, default values in data classes, and started learning about how to get user input. I still want to study and learn because I know its long term value, but I think I want to do a lot of learning through projects I will build in the future. I really love the challenge.

<p>
    Today, I learned that recently Android studio has released what seems to be a major patch that took Jetpack compose from a secondary option to a primary option instead of the xml documents that seem to have been popular prior to the recent update. And as result of that, there is a lot of mixed info about how to build UI elements in Android studio. Well, at least now I got everything straightened out and I am determined despite the setback to still meet my deadline.

<p>
    Today, I learned about the benefits of creating a (in my case) rough mockup of what I want the app to look like. I have really been struggling to get even the most basic part of my app built this time around. It has felt like my head has been in a fog and was unable to figure out even the smallest portion of where or how to start. Yesterday, I watched a short 46 minute tutorial on how to create a basic calculator using the tools I have chosen, and on of the biggest things that hit me was seeing how he referenced an image of what he wanted the app to look like to guide his programming efforts. Today, when I created my own (admittedly very basic) mockups, it instantly pulled my head out of the fog I have been stuck in for the past week. I still have a few more to go before I am done, but wow, that helped a lot.

    Building a app from Jetpack is a lot harder than I was expecting. I am still determined to get this built.

    Yay! I finally started making progress! I got my first few buttons on the screen, and started building functions to make them operable. I realized I had been trying to use outdated info to build my app with. I am still hoping to get a workable app by tomorrow, which is my deadline, but that will be a bit of a stretch to achieve at this point. If not, then getting a workable app will be the next thing I go back to in the future sprints after I finish my preplanned projects.

    Well I set a deadline and finished work on my app today. I did not get as far as I wanted with it, but I will still be moving on to the next project starting Monday. As I got started with the app, I got intimidated by the idea of working with a UI for the first time and I stopped using the scientific method for learning and building. Instead of getting started on the project, and learning as I ran into problems, I started learning and then tried to apply that retroactively to my project. From there, when that ran into a problem, I went back to the drawing board and started learning all over again. Additionally, starting off, I used only a very few sources (despite linking to more than I used) and then found that the sources I was using were not for the technologies I was trying to use for this project. Ultimately, I caught myself and corrected my behaviors and made some real progress on the app. But it will be one that I will be going back to after this class is over. Or possibly at the end of the class if I get ahead. Going forward, I will be trying to figure out what the 20% most useful skills are for a project and then learning those, and from there, dive into the project as fast as possible, while making sure to maintain a learn as I go mentality.

    Wow! There is a lot to Firebase. I am going to enjoy actually putting it to use. Given I want to build a basic financial manager app, I have a few tools I want to take advantage of. Tomorrow, I will finish my plan for my app and have a better idea of the features I plan to use.

    Today, I finished my initial study of Google Firebase and got a basic plan built for my app. Tomorrow, I will spend 2 hours on a tutorial for Firebase and Jetpack Compose, and then will get into my app. My plan is to be able to build an app that will require a basic login (I am currently planning on requiring a login with Google option) and then will let users enter income, expenses, and track budgets. I am also hoping to be able to build the option to generate a few simple reports.

    Today, I studied a wonderful 9 part series on how to build a simple to do app using both Jetpack and Firebase. It was really informative. Tomorrow, I will finish the tutorial that linked to the article series. I think the thing I liked about it the most was seeing the logic of building a complete app using the tools I am using.

    Today, I started going through the Build an Android app with Firebase and Jetpack Compose tutorial. I am happily taking my time diving into it. I could probably go a lot faster, but I enjoy getting side tracked asking questions of my friendly AI search engine. Why is such a fun and powerful question to ask.

    Well I figured out what I did wrong with my fitness app and why I ran into so many problems with it. I did not have the plugins and dependencies set up properly for my project. For my Finance app, I used a tutorial Google made teaching you how to make a task manager app to figure out how to get the dependencies set up properly, and given the differences in some of current file versions, I still had a lot I had to figure out on my own, like for example, I had to force the material3 plugin to the current stable version before the basic hello world would run properly. I am already happy with how well my current project is going compared to my last one. I am happy I chose to push ahead. It gave me a fresh perspective that let me figure out where I was getting stuck on the last project.

    Wow that felt good. Finally a productive day. Today, I got my app properly planned out for at least the major parts to it. I will have a data class that will store 4 data points as a different data type, a list to store the entered transactions, a function to process withdrawals, process deposits, collect deposits from the user, collect withdrawals from the user, display transactions, calculate total, display total, save data, and delete transaction. Additionally, it will have a function to convert each of the 4 different data types from the strings that the user will enter into the correct data types, and will have another function to check if the transaction amount was entered as a positive number. It will store info in the cloud using Google Firebase, and will have a function that calls a function in the cloud to delete all their data if so desired. Today, I wrote the data class, the function to convert the string containing the transaction amount into the BigData type (used for number accuracy), and the function that makes sure the number was entered as a positive number.

    Today, I got a function written to take in a string as an argument, collect the current date format from the users device, try to format that string as a date type variable and return the current date if there is an error in parsing the date string. I also wrote a function to track the current available balance, and then a function that takes in a string transaction amount, a raw date string, a string containing the description of a transaction (all collected from the user), and a Boolean value telling whether it is a deposit or not, and converts it to a prebuilt data class, and then adds it to a list of transactions. I also built a mockup of the UI for my app. And tomorrow, I get to build that UI, add a few things from Firebase into the app and should (hopefully) be able to finish it.

    Today, I started to build a text box to enter data, but after a few hours of digging found that I might have some conflicting and/or missing requirements in my app, and while I did not get anywhere near as far as I was hoping, I still learned a lot and made progress on a prior area I struggled in and that makes me happy.

    Today, I finished the plan and concept for my forth project, a data analysis app. I know that people are creatures of habit and that those habits form patterns in almost every area of their lives. There are several questions that I have been wondering about for years relating to the stock market. Do the habits that fill our lives spill over into patterns within the stock market? Is there a certain day of the week when the stocks of a particular company tend to be lower or higher? Are there certain times of the year when the stocks tend to be higher or lower? I know that for cyclical companies, their stocks are going to rise and fall with the economy, and that for counter cyclical companies, their stocks will move in the opposite direction of the economy as a whole, but are there other patterns. My goal with this project, at least at first, is to build a program that will let me filter the data by different combinations of both days of the week, week of the year, and month, and will then get several different types of ways to summarize the data.

    Wow! Today was a wonderful 10 hours of productivity. I got the raw data for my project cleaned up and formatted to get it ready to use, figured out a few extra calculated data points I wanted ready access to and created new columns to store them in, summarized all of the data, and built visualizations for each major data column of data I am analyzing, summarized the data in the first column of data I will be focusing on for my first question, prepped the summary statistics for later use, and wrote a paragraph describing those summary statistics. In the process, I learned how to loop through columns of data, pull out specific characters and replace them with others while setting the remaining data as a specific data type, converted a date entered as a string to a type date data, saved the data to a new file setting both index and encoding standards, learned how to use the .describe method, learned how to use the .dt, .day_name(), .month_name(), isocalendar() .week, .quarter, .day, and .dayofyear methods. I also learned how to use the .subplots(), .plot(), tight_layout(), show(), nunique(),DataFrame(), and .concat() methods along with the label, color, and loc arguments. Finally, I learned how to pull individual data points out of the .describe() method. Tomorrow is my scheduled day off, and then Monday, I get to start doing to comparative analysis to see if I can formally find the answer to my question. Based on the summary data I have already gathered, I am pretty sure I know the answer to my first question, but I will resist jumping to any conclusions until after I have finished analyzing the data.

    Today, I finished analyzing the DailyRange in Tesla Stock and found that there was no significant impact in Tesla stock prices when there were large gaps between the high and low prices. In fact, it seems that the larger the gap the more even the chances for the prices to go either high or low. I also discovered that the vast majority of Tesla stock prices occur within the 1st quartile of daily range prices, and only a very small percentage occurs outside of that range. The next Question I am going to work on is the question of, "Is a high volume of trades in a day good for Tesla Stock prices?"

    Today, I refactored my code, creating 3 functions that made my code a lot more reusable. It also let me finish analyzing the data for my second question and expand the analysis to include an actual correlation analysis. I am happy I chose to do that, because despite how the data looked on the surface, I found a weak positive correlation that suggests there might be other data in play in the connection, which opens up the door for my next question, which will be to see if there is a connection between the day of the week and the closing price.
