    Today, I got a decent amount of progress on the last part of my programming final, and met with my group to demo what we had done. I was the only one who built my programs to be scalable beyond the basic requirements.

    Today I started studying the book Beginning Câ™¯ object-oriented programming by Dan Clark. While I am between semesters I am going to dive deeper into a few areas of Object Oriented Programming that I want a more solid foundation in before I get into Programming with Data Structures next semester.

    For the class I just finished on programming with classes, they gave us a whole folder to run our C# programs out of. Between today, and yesterday, I have discovered why it is they chose that shortcut option. It is a lot of work to set up VS code to run C#.

    Today, I learned about aggregation and composition relationships in Object-Oriented Programming. A car has an aggregation relationship with its engine. The car and the engine are separate objects, and can both exist and function (in some manner) without the other, but they also join together to do more than they would by themselves. On the other hand, an order and an order item are both separate objects, but an order item cannot exist without the order, this is an example of a composition relationship.
