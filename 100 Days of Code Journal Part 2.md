<p>
    Today, I got a decent amount of progress on the last part of my programming final, and met with my group to demo what we had done. I was the only one who built my programs to be scalable beyond the basic requirements. 
</p>

<p>
    Today I started studying the book Beginning Câ™¯ object-oriented programming by Dan Clark. While I am between semesters I am going to dive deeper into a few areas of Object Oriented Programming that I want a more solid foundation in before I get into Programming with Data Structures next semester.

<p>
    For the class I just finished on programming with classes, they gave us a whole folder to run our C# programs out of. Between today, and yesterday, I have discovered why it is they chose that shortcut option. It is a lot of work to set up VS code to run C#.

<p>
    Today, I spent some more time in my OOP book and started learning how to use Visual Studio, instead of just VS Code. 
</p>

<h3>
    Friday, 7 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I dug deeper into Visual Studio. I am amazed at just how much more power it has than Visual Studio Code. I also read in my OOP book more. 
</p>

<h3>
    Monday, 10 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I read more in my OOP book, reviewed Python variables, strings, functions, loops, and classes, and then started going through the learning material for my next class.
</p>
<h1>
    Day 210
</h1>
<h3>
    Tuesday, 11 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I learned that the object portion of object oriented programming is specifically referring to a specific instance of a class. I also learned about big O notation and about thinking in terms of software efficiency. 
</p>
<h1>
    Day 211

<h3>
    Wednesday, 12 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I got a quick overview of proper methods to review code, chaining, hashing, hashing functions, open addressing, sets, and sparse lists.I also learned about interfaces, abstract classes, sealed classes, and partial classes from my OOP book. 
</p>

    Thursday, 13 April, 2023

<p>
    Today, I got introduced to maps, linked lists, recursion, and trees. I also read more in my OOP book.

<h3>
    Friday, 14 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I learned about aggregation and composition relationships in Object-Oriented Programming. A car has an aggregation relationship with its engine. The car and the engine are separate objects, and can both exist and function (in some manner) without the other, but they also join together to do more than they would by themselves. On the other hand, an order and an order item are both separate objects, but an order item cannot exist without the order, this is an example of a composition relationship.

    Today, I started to analyze code for how it would translate in Big O notation. 
</p>

<p>
    Today, I studied more about big O notation. I am not happy with my level of understanding about it, so I want to delve much deeper. 
</p>
<h1>
    Day 219

<h3>
    Friday, 21 April, 2023

<p>
    Today, I studied a bit more into Big O notation. It is slowly starting to make more sense. 
</p>
<h1>
    Day 220
</h1>
<h3>
    Saturday, 22 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I built two programs, one used a loop and then list comprehension to add divisors of a given number to a list. The other program dynamically pulled numbers from one of two lists to append them to a combined list, based on values in a third list.

    Monday, 24 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I finished the chapter in my book on Big O notation and started to work on evaluating the assigned code for its big O notation. Last week, I was a little uneasy about my understanding of big O notation, now, I am happily feeling a lot more confident both in my understanding of big O and my ability to analyze code in general.
</p>

<h3>
    Wednesday, 25 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I finished studying big O notation. I am happy I dug in as much as I did to understand it. Thanks to the time I spent studying big O notation, not only do I have a better understanding of how to evaluate algorithms, I also have a better grasp of understanding code in general. Tomorrow, I will start learning about understanding code using reviews and stacks.
</p>

    Day 223

<h3>
    Wednesday, 26 April, 2023

<p>
    Today, I practiced with analyzing code without running it. In this case, the code in question used the stack in different ways.

    Thursday, 27 April, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    When I was first presented with the idea of manually reviewing code and mapping it out did not make sense at all. However, I am learning something new, and the people teaching me know a lot more than I currently do, so I put my full effort into the process. Now, I am glad I did, because I feel that reviewing code to the level I did fore this assignment made me a better programmer. 
</p>

    Day 225

<h3>
    Friday, 28 April, 2023

<p>
    Today, I learned about testing code. I have had previous lessons in it, but there is still a lot to learn.
</p>
<h1>
    Day 226

<h3>
    Saturday, 29 April, 2023

<p>
    Today, I started analyzing code I was provided to find the bugs in it. In this case everything runs, it just does not provide the right results

</h1>
<h3>
    Tuesday, 2 May, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Got two of the three defects fixed for the first program we were assigned to me. I found that instead of adding the names to the end, it was adding the names to the beginning of the queue.
</p>

    Day 229
</h1>
<h3>
    Wednesday, 3 May, 2023
</h3>
<p>
    Today, I finished working on the last of my assignment working with queues. To accomplish this, I analyzed two programs provided to me, to figure out what they do. I used previously written test code in one of the programs and a description of what the program should do, to debug the code. And for the other program, I used a description of what the program should do, to write test code and then find and fix bugs in the code.

<h3>
    Friday, 5 May, 2023

<p>
    Today, analyzed the code I was given, the requirements I need to meet and started working on a plan for how to build the code I will be writing. I am going to be writing code to find matches in letters that might not be in the same order.
