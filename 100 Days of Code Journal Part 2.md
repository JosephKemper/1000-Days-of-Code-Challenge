    Today, I got a decent amount of progress on the last part of my programming final, and met with my group to demo what we had done. I was the only one who built my programs to be scalable beyond the basic requirements.

    Today I started studying the book Beginning Câ™¯ object-oriented programming by Dan Clark. While I am between semesters I am going to dive deeper into a few areas of Object Oriented Programming that I want a more solid foundation in before I get into Programming with Data Structures next semester.

    For the class I just finished on programming with classes, they gave us a whole folder to run our C# programs out of. Between today, and yesterday, I have discovered why it is they chose that shortcut option. It is a lot of work to set up VS code to run C#.

    Today, I dug deeper into Visual Studio. I am amazed at just how much more power it has than Visual Studio Code. I also read in my OOP book more.
