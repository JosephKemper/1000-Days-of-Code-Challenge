# probability-example
An simple game exploring probabilities.

Create a game that allows a user to choose from the following games to play. Users start with 10 points. For each game, the user will win points for guessing correctly, and lose points for guessing incorrectly

1. Coin Flip (1 point)
A coin flip is displayed. User guesess if the next flip will match or not. 

2. Die Roll (2 points)
A die will be rolled. User guesess if the new roll is higher or lower. 

3. Card Draw (5 points)
A card is drawn from the deck. User guesess if the next card is higher or lower. If user plays the game multiple times in a row, the cards are NOT replaced, but when leaving and returning, the cards are replaced.

The game ends when the user gets 100 points, gets 0 points, or enters "quit"

Save a file with user names and their point values. Allow a user to load a pervious game or start as a new player.
